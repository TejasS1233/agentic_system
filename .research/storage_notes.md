Jaccard Similarity

The Jaccard similarity measures the similarity between two sets of data to see which members are shared and distinct.  
formula is a intersection b divided by the union of a and b

Compose checker
NEED to ensure that agar tools have to be used as composite input output format is consisten for all of them NO exceptions

made edges based on the functions, primary doubt / improvement is can compose is based off only I/O but it should be both this and some degree of functionality


used faiss for embedding coz lightweight + extremely fast
this is heavily reliant on the classification , domain assgn


Questions/thoughts
why use jaccard(ai free) might have better alternatives
can we add other edges(relations) contenders : REQUIRES, ALTERNATIVE_TO , DEPRECIATED_BY
might have to eventually switch to an actual vector db IFF tools>1000

add negative tags to reduce false postives
weighted retrieval maybe
